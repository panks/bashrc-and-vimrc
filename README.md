bashrc-and-vimrc
================

My .bashrc and .vimrc

I tend to format my system quit frequently, 
so I thought it would be a nice idea to push my bashrc and vimrc (yeah yeah emacs is cool too, but somehow I tend to like vim better) to git.

So in vimrc you would get some general vim features like syntax highlighting, rules, better search, etc etc.
and bashrc is pretty customized to my needs (in fact nothing much is there as of now), still just for your info, I wrote a function to setup KDE build environment, for obvious reasons..


Feel free to fork, if it suits you needs.
